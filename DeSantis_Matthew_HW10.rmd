## (a)
```{r}
phat = 985/1516
n = 1516
SE = sqrt(phat*(1-phat)/n)
alpha = qnorm(0.975)
upper = phat + SE*alpha
lower = phat - SE*alpha
upper
lower
```

## (b)
False. The true proportion value and the interval obtained in part a are both non-random constants, so it doesn't make sense to talk about probability with regards to them.

## (a)

phatpr = 75/193
alpha = qnorm(0.975)
n = (4*(alpha^2)*phatpr*(1-phatpr))/(0.06^2)
ceiling(n)

## (b)
```{r}
phatpr = 0.5
alpha = qnorm(0.975)
n = (4*(alpha^2)*phatpr*(1-phatpr))/(0.06^2)
ceiling(n)
